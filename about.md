### Education & Expertise

I have been working with data and statistics since 2005. Since then I have taught myself SQL, statistics, Python, R, machine learning, Powershell, data visualization, and a lot more.

I am passionately curious and stubborn. I love solving real problems.

* I ask questions, build prototypes, collaborate, and strive towards progress.
* I enjoy explaining insights using data visualization.
* I love working with statistics and machine learning (supervised and unsupervised algorithms, cross-validation, ensembling, and vector math).
* I'm good at finding, cleaning, and assembling data from different sources.
* I love working with databases (design, query tuning, indexes, ETL).
